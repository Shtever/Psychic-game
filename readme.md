In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a game in which the user would have a set number of attempts to guess a randomly chosen letter of the alphabet.

After the user won the game or exhausted all of their attempts, the site will log a win or loss.

During the game, the user's incorrect guesses are logged to prevent duplicating a wrong answer.

This assignment required us to use the Javascript lessons we've learned in class including, but not limited to:
    -Javascript Syntax
    -Functions
    -Use of onKeyUp event listeners
    -.push to array
    -getDocumentbyID statements
    -if/else if/else conditional statements
